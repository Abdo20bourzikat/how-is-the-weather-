          Hey, that is the <strong>how is the weather website</strong>, you can enter any city you need,
          and you can see how much temperature, humidity percentage, wind speed.
          The idea of producing this website came to me in my first days of learning programming,
          for order to develop my skills in programming,
          after i asked myself why don't i make something that people can benefit from?
